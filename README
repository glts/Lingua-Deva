Text::Deva
----------

Perl module for converting Sanskrit in Latin transliteration to Devanagari and
vice-versa.

This module comes with full documentation and illustrative unit tests.  Please
take a look at those to learn what it can do and how to use it.

"Text::Deva" depends on some of Perl's Unicode features.  Input is required to
be in UTF-8 encoding.  A modern, Unicode-capable version of Perl >= 5.12.1 is
obligatory.
