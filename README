Text::Deva version 1.00
-----------------------

Perl module for converting Latin script transliterated Sanskrit into
Devanagari and vice-versa.

The "Text::Deva" package provides the principal interface to convert between
Devanagari and Latin, the target language being Sanskrit.  Conversion can be
done directly via the "to_deva()" and "to_latin()" methods.

    my $d = Text::Deva->new();
    say $d->to_latin("आसीद्राजा");
    say $d->to_deva("Nalo nāma");

Internally, all input is first transformed into an object representation
called "aksara".  This object representation is available as the package
"Text::Deva::Aksara" and provides an interface to manipulate and query
individual "aksaras".

This module comes with full documentation and illustrative unit tests.  These
should help you make an informed choice whether you actually need this module.

Please be aware that Text::Deva depends heavily on Unicode features.  Input is
required to be in UTF-8 encoding.  A modern, Unicode-capable version of Perl
>= 5.12.1 is obligatory.

INSTALLATION

To install this module the usual procedure for Perl modules applies:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you want to try specific tests before the installation, you need to run
them with the appropriate include, for example:

    perl -Ilib t/Deva.t

To preview the embedded documentation you may use any one of these commands:

    pod2text lib/Text/Deva.pm
    pod2html lib/Text/Deva.pm > deva.pm.html
    pod2man -u lib/Text/Deva.pm | nroff -Tutf8 -man | less

Prefer the first two of these options as *roff unfortunately doesn't support
UTF-8 encoding yet.

USAGE

Usage instructions are included with the documentation.  The following script
converts a Latin input text file "in.txt" to Devanagari "out.txt".

    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    use v5.12.1;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use open ':encoding(UTF-8)';
    use Text::Deva;

    open my $in,  '<', 'in.txt'  or die;
    open my $out, '>', 'out.txt' or die;

    my $d = Text::Deva->new();
    while (my $line = <$in>) {
        print $out $d->to_deva($line);
    }

On a Unicode-capable terminal one-liners are also possible:

    echo "Himālaya" | perl -MText::Deva -e 'print Text::Deva->new()->to_deva(<>);'
