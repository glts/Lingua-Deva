Text::Deva version 1.00
-----------------------

Perl module for transforming Latin script transliterated Sanskrit into
Devanagari.

The Text::Deva module provides functions to transform some input into
transliterated characters, into Aksara objects (for which a type is defined in
Text::Deva::Aksara), and a translation function. [describe what it can do].

The encoding for all input and output is assumed to be UTF-8.  If your data is
in a different encoding you will have to transform it first.

This module includes Unit tests and an examples section in the documentation.
These should help you see what it can do and make an informed choice whether
you want to install it [Other info before it is installed]

This module requires a modern Unicode-capable version of Perl >= 5.12.1.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following on your command line.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you want to try specific tests before installation, you need to run them
with the appropriate lib included, eg.

    perl -Ilib t/tokenize.t

To preview the embedded documentation you may use any one of these commands:

    pod2text lib/Text/Deva.pm
    pod2html lib/Text/Deva.pm > deva.pm.html
    pod2man -u lib/Text/Deva.pm | nroff -Tutf8 -man | less

Unfortunately, *roff still doesn't support UTF-8 encoding, so the output for
the last command will not be entirely correct.

USAGE

Example usage. Simple script:

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use Data::Dumper;
    use Deva;
    use strict;

    while (<>) {
        chomp;
        my @tokens = Deva::tokenize($_);
        my @aksaras = Deva::aksarize(\@tokens);
        print Dumper(\@aksaras);
    }

The simplest usage for transforming some file "in.txt" to standard output
would be the following one-liner:

perl -w -MText::Deva -nle 'print Text::Deva::tokenize($_);' < in.txt

or:

echo "Himālaya" | perl -MText::Deva -ne 'print @{Text::Deva::tokenize($_)};'
echo "Kāmasūtra" | perl -MText::Deva -ne 'use Text::Deva qw(translate); print translate($_);'
echo "Kāmasūtra" | perl -Ilib -M'Text::Deva(translate)' -ne 'print translate($_);' # <== how about this?
echo "Kāmasūtra" | perl -Ilib -MText::Deva -ne 'print Text::Deva->new()->translate($_);'

TODO I can see only the last one of these working right now!
TODO The recommended way is '-nle' but for me only '-ne' works as expected!
TODO don't forget to get rid of the .DS_Store files!!! (perlmake sees them?)

DEPENDENCIES

This module depends only on the standard Perl modules which are normally
present if you have Perl installed.

Apart from that, a modern Unicode-capable version of Perl >= 5.12 is required.
