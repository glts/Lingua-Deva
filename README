Text::Deva version 1.00
-----------------------

Perl module for converting Latin transliterated Sanskrit into Devanagari and
vice-versa.

The package "Text::Deva" provides the principal interface for the conversion
between Devanagari and Latin, the target language being Sanskrit.

This module comes with full documentation and illustrative unit tests.  Take a
look at them before installing the module.

Please be aware that "Text::Deva" depends on Perl's Unicode features.  Input
is required to be in UTF-8 encoding.  A modern, Unicode-capable version of
Perl >= 5.12.1 is obligatory.

INSTALLATION

To install this module the usual procedure for Perl modules applies:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you want to try specific tests before the installation, you need to run
them with the appropriate include, for example:

    perl -Ilib t/Deva.t

To preview the embedded documentation you may use any one of these commands:

    pod2text lib/Text/Deva.pm
    pod2html lib/Text/Deva.pm > deva.pm.html
    pod2man -u lib/Text/Deva.pm | nroff -Tutf8 -man | less

Prefer the first two of these options as *roff unfortunately doesn't support
UTF-8 encoding yet.

USAGE

Usage instructions are included with the documentation.  The simplest usage
pattern is to call "to_deva()" or "to_latin()" on a "Text::Deva" instance:

    use Text::Deva;
    my $d = Text::Deva->new();
    say $d->to_latin("आसीद्राजा");
    say $d->to_deva("Nalo nāma");
